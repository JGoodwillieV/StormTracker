## Common Questions

### Q: Why two separate reports?
**A**: Different data sources and purposes!
- **Meet results** = Competition performance (what matters for scoring)
- **Test sets** = Training performance (what matters for practice planning)

### Q: Which should I check more often?
**A**: 
- **Category Progress (meets)**: Check weekly via dashboard widget
- **Test Set Progress (practice)**: Check monthly in reports section

### Q: Can I see individual swimmer data?
**A**: Yes! In both reports:
1. Open full report
2. Expand a stroke section
3. See individual swims/test sets with swimmer names

### Q: What does "Pace per 100" mean?
**A**: It normalizes times so you can compare different distances fairly.

**Example**:
- 50 Free in 25.0s → **50.0s per 100**
- 100 Free in 60.0s → **60.0s per 100**

Now you know 50s are faster than 100s (expected!).

### Q: Should I always use "Pace per 100"?
**A**: Yes, in most cases! Only turn it off if:
- All your meets/tests are the same distance
- You want to see raw times

### Q: Why is Category Progress on Dashboard but Test Set Progress isn't?
**A**: 
- **Meet results** are most important for competition planning
- Coaches need quick access to competition trends
- Dashboard = High-priority info
- Test sets are important but don't need daily monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### "No data in Category Progress"
- ✅ Enter meet results in the system
- ✅ Ensure event names are formatted correctly (e.g., "50 Free")
- ✅ Try different time ranges

### "No data in Test Set Progress"
- ✅ Record some test sets first
- ✅ Ensure test sets use main strokes (free, back, breast, fly, IM)
- ✅ Check that times were recorded

### "Chart looks weird"
- ✅ Make sure "Pace per 100" is ON
- ✅ Need more data points (at least 3-4 sessions/meets)
- ✅ Check for data entry errors

### "Can't find Test Set Progress"
- ✅ It's ONLY in Reports section (not on Dashboard)
- ✅ Look for indigo/purple card
- ✅ It's the 9th card in Reports menu
