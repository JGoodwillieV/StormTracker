## ✨ Key Features

### Smart Scoring System
Each event recommendation is scored based on:
- **Recent improvement** (last 90 days)
- **Standards proximity** (how close to next B/BB/A/AA/AAA/AAAA)
- **Team record opportunities**
- **Signature events** (swimmer's top 3)
- **Event pairing intelligence** (avoids brutal lineups)

### Event Pairing Intelligence
- Prevents multiple distance events back-to-back
- Rewards complementary events (e.g., 50 Free + 100 Free)
- Warns about close spacing in same session
- Automatically avoids conflicts in Championship mode

### Three Recommendation Modes
1. **Championship**: Best events only, no experiments
2. **Balanced**: Mix of strong and developmental events
3. **Developmental**: Encourages trying new events

### Meet Type Presets
One-click configurations for common scenarios:
- Championship meets
- Dual meets
- B/C meets  
- Qualifying meets

- **Score Breakdown**: Performance / Opportunity / Strategic
- **Seed Time**: Best previous time (or "NT" for new events)
- **Reasons**: Why this event was recommended
  - 📈 "Improved 3.2% in last 90 days"
  - 🎯 "0.8s from AA standard"
  - 🏆 "Signature event (top 3)"
  - ⚠️ "May be close to another event"
