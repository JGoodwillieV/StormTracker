# Category Progress - Quick Start Guide

## What Is It?

The Category Progress feature shows you how each stroke category (Freestyle, Backstroke, Breaststroke, Butterfly, and IM) improves over the season using beautiful line graphs.

## How to Access

### Option 1: From Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Open StormTracker
2. Look for the **"Category Progress"** widget on your dashboard (it's right above "Practice Test Sets")
3. Click **"View Report"** to see the full analysis

### Option 2: From Reports Section
1. Click **"Reports"** in the sidebar
2. Click the **"Category Progress"** card (cyan/blue colored)
3. View the full report

## Understanding the Data

### What You'll See

**Dashboard Widget** (Quick View):
- Small line chart showing recent trends (last 30 days)
- Improvement percentages for each stroke
- Quick access to full report

**Full Report** (Detailed View):
- Large interactive chart with all strokes over entire season
- Summary cards showing session counts and improvement
- Expandable sections with every test set listed
- Toggle between "Pace per 100" and "Raw Average"

### Reading the Charts

**📉 Lines Going Down = GOOD!** (Swimmers are getting faster)
**📈 Lines Going Up = Need Work** (Times are getting slower)

**Colors**:
- 🔵 Blue = Freestyle
- 🟣 Purple = Backstroke
- 🟢 Green = Breaststroke
- 🟡 Amber = Butterfly
- 🔴 Pink = Individual Medley

### Pace per 100 vs Raw Average

**"Pace per 100" (Default - Recommended)**:
- Normalizes times to compare different distances fairly
- A 25yd test set and 100yd test set can be compared side-by-side
- Shows seconds per 100 yards
- **Use this** when you have test sets with different distances

**"Raw Average"**:
- Shows actual average times in seconds
- No normalization
- **Use this** when comparing test sets of the same distance

**Example**:
```
Test Set A: 25yd Freestyle → 12.0s average
  - Pace per 100: 48.0s

Test Set B: 100yd Freestyle → 60.0s average
  - Pace per 100: 60.0s

Conclusion: Swimmers are faster on 25s than 100s (as expected)
```

### Improvement Percentages

**What the numbers mean**:
- ↓ 3.2% = Swimmers got 3.2% faster (GOOD!)
- ↑ 1.5% = Swimmers got 1.5% slower (needs work)
- 0% = No change

**How it's calculated**:
Compares the FIRST session to the MOST RECENT session for each stroke.

## Common Questions

### Q: Why don't I see any data?
**A**: You need to have recorded test sets with results. The feature only tracks these stroke types: free, back, breast, fly, and IM. Other stroke types (drill, kick, choice) are not included.

### Q: Why does one stroke show way different improvement than others?
**A**: Consider:
1. Number of sessions recorded (more sessions = more accurate trends)
2. Different distances being tested
3. Make sure you're using "Pace per 100" mode for fair comparison

### Q: Can I see individual swimmer progress?
**A**: Currently, this report shows **team-wide** averages. Individual swimmer stroke progress is visible on their profile page in the "Practice" tab.

### Q: What if I want to focus on just one stroke?
**A**: 
1. Open the full Category Progress Report
2. Click on a stroke's summary card to expand details
3. See all test sets for that stroke listed chronologically

### Q: How recent is the data?
**A**: 
- **Dashboard Widget**: Shows last 30 days
- **Full Report**: Shows entire season (all recorded test sets)

## Tips for Coaches

### Tip 1: Track Weekly Progress
Check the Category Progress widget on your dashboard each Monday to see last week's trends.

### Tip 2: Identify Focus Areas
If a stroke shows flat or upward trends, consider dedicating more practice time to that stroke.

### Tip 3: Celebrate Wins
Use the improvement percentages to motivate your team! Share stats like "Our butterfly improved 5% this month!"

### Tip 4: Season Planning
Use the full report at the start/middle/end of season to:
- Set goals for weak strokes
- Track progress toward meet season
- Adjust training focus

### Tip 5: Parent Communication
Show parents concrete data on team improvement. The visual graphs are easy to understand and impressive!

## Example Workflow

### Start of Season
1. Record baseline test sets for each stroke
2. Check Category Progress - you'll see just a few data points
3. Set improvement goals (e.g., "Improve freestyle pace by 5% before Championships")

### During Season
1. Record test sets regularly (weekly or bi-weekly)
2. Check dashboard widget for quick trends
3. If a stroke isn't improving, adjust practice plan
4. Click "View Report" monthly for detailed analysis

### End of Season
1. Open full Category Progress Report
2. Compare first vs. last sessions
3. Celebrate improvements!
4. Share report with team/parents
5. Use data to plan next season's focus

## Troubleshooting

### Widget shows "No category data yet"
**Solution**: Record some test sets! Make sure they use main stroke types (free, back, breast, fly, IM).

### Chart looks weird or jagged
**Solution**: 
1. Make sure test sets are consistent in distance
2. Try toggling between "Pace per 100" and "Raw Average"
3. Check that all test sets have results recorded

### Can't click "View Report"
**Solution**: Make sure you have test set data. The button only appears when data exists.

### Numbers seem wrong
**Solution**:
1. Verify times were recorded correctly in original test sets
2. Check that you're comparing similar distances (use "Pace per 100")
3. Ensure test sets are dated correctly

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with Category Progress:

1. ✅ Record test sets regularly for accurate trends
2. ✅ Check the dashboard widget weekly
3. ✅ Review the full report monthly
4. ✅ Use data to inform practice planning
5. ✅ Share improvements with team and parents
